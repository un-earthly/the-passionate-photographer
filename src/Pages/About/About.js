                My Goal Is to be a better developer. and land my first dev job within the next 6 months. to achieve that goal I've started practicing code for 8-12 hours daily, I'm reading the documentation and getting familiar with new frameworks, and learning how to implement them in my projects. I'm learning how to communicate better in English and use it as a better communication tool. taking support and lessons from the course and youtube, reading blogs and articles about the field, and new improvements updates. if I got stuck somewhere I try to figure it out by myself and reading articles about that problem and watching videos to solve that problem. making projects and doing the assignments sincerely. I'll give every possible effort to achieve this goal.
